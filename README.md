# Class Projects

Each of these projects was a large project that I had to create for the class that I was in. Most of these projects were completed by myself, with the exception of one project that was a group project. Each of the Projects will list the class that the project was apart of, as well as the goal and the final product that was created at the end. The list of the class projects that I worked on can be listed as follows: 

* [Add Numbers Project](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/PastProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Class%20Projects/AddNumbersFinal/About-Add-Numbers.md)
* [Image Classification Project](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/PastProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Class%20Projects/Image%20Classification%20Project/About-Image-Classification-Project.md)
* [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/PastProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Class%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20Project/About-Machine-Learning-Project.md)
